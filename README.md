# Hackathon Hackers Design Pack

The HH Design Pack is a collection of resources for the branding of the Hackathon Hackers community. Feel free to use the contents of this repository for anything related to HH or its subgroups.

You'll need Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, or a compatible program to edit these files.

## Contents

* `Subgroup Template.psd`: A Photoshop document you can optionally use to create a cover photo for your subgroup. Feel free to modify anything and everything, or create your own entirely!
* `Main Group Template.ai`: A Photoshop document to make variations of the main group cover photo. Think Google Doodle, only more h4x.
* `Ico.ai`: An Illustrator document with the vector of Ico, the mascot of Hackathon Hackers.
* `Dosis Font/`: The typography used in the subgroup cover photo template.
